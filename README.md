# HTML Rendered Snake in Javascript üêç

This snake game works with JavaScript and CSS, adding arrowkeys or arrowbuttons on mobile, starting of like a regular game of snake, but quickly getting trickier. Educational project mainly to get comfortable with js.

The visuals are rendered on screen by adding and modifying object in the DOM, adding or removing classes to change colors, adding rotation or scaling them and so on. So not using a canvas element.
